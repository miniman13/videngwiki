### Makito X (Harsh)

## Device Limitations
The Haivision Makito X doesn't support RTMPS (RTMP over TLS/SSL), meaning you cannot stream (directly) to platforms like Facebook or Cloudflare who require RTMPS. (A Haivision Support representative stated on their support portal that there are no plans to add RTMPS support on the Makito X Encoder).


# Documentation

## Factory Reset
To reset the Haivision Makito use a paper-clip to hold down the reset button on the encoder. After ~5 seconds the status light will turn red and the device will reboot with a factory-default configuraiton. The encoder can remain powered the entire duration of the factory reset.

> When factory-reset, Haivision Makito X has a default username of `admin` and a default password of `manager`.
{.is-info}

Once reset is complete Makito will reboot with the factory default settings:
**IP Address**: `10.5.1.2`
**Subnet Mask**: `255.255.0.0`
**Gateway**: `10.5.0.1`

## REST API
The Makito X has an undocumented HTTP API.

### Authentication
A session cookie is passed in the header, for example `Cookie: SessionID=SESSID000000000`.
