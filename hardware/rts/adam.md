# RTS Adam Intercom
The RTS family of Digital Intercom Matrices is the most extensive, widely used, scalable and backwards compatible line of intercoms in the world today. The high-end ADAM 2 Matrix supports 8 to 880 users per system; 512 ports possible in just a seven RU (Rack Units) frame.

Utilizing a patented TDM (Time Division Multiplex) technique, the ADAM 2 grows linearly as users are added. The system comes standard with redundant universal power supplies (100-240 VAC), and supports redundant controllers, allowing for automatic changeover in the event of failure.

ADAM 2 is available with a wide variety of Interface cards in the industry, including the MADI-16, OMI, AIO-16A, and RVON + interfaces. It also has the wide variety of cabling options, including RJ11, RJ45, DB9, jack fields, and many others.

With its second generation controller card, Ethernet connectivity is achieved between the ADAM 2 Intercom and AZedit. ADAM 2 can support 32 simultaneous AZedit sessions.

# ADAM Frame
The ADAM Frame (Advanced Digital Audio Matrix) is a card based frame that allows you to integrate multiple types of intercom formats into a single controlled platform. It includes two controller cards for configuration.

# Frame Control Protocols
The cards can be controlled via AZEdit using serial or IP. If you are using the IP based cards, you can also communicate to the card using SNMP.
