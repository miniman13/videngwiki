# Patchbays


There are three types of patchbay signal arrangments that you may see.
* First is "non normalled". The signal just passes front to back, and that's it.
* Second is "full normal". The signal will pass between the two connectors on the rear. If you insert a patch cable into either position on the front it will interrupt the flow and send it out the patch cable.
* Third is "half normal", and you will only see that with audio. The signal will pass between the two connectors on the rear. If you insert a patch cable into the top it will split the signal. If you insert a cable into the bottom it will interrupt it.
