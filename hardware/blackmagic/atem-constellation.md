# Atem Constellation

### Recovery Mode
To enter Recovery Mode, Hold the "Set" button down and power the unit. You should see the Set button light. At this point, connect the USB cable and run the ATEM Setup Utility. You should be able to apply a firmware update at this point.<sup>[1](https://discord.com/channels/494428283094564864/494428766525718528/1042895049169580112)</sup> <sup>[2](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=161942)</sup>

> ATEM switchers, include ATEM Constellation 8K, are not equipped with a "Factory Reset" function. Recovery Mode only allows you to force the firmware to be loaded into the ATEM switcher by entering the Bootloader mode, when the switcher firmware is corrupted, but it does not reset the unity to factory conditions. <sup>[3](https://discord.com/channels/494428283094564864/494428766525718528/1042907220741996604)</sup>
