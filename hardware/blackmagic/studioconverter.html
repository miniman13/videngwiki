<h1>2013 ATEM Talkback Converter 4K</h1>
<p>The ATEM Studio Talkback Converter 4K ($2,495 starting price) is an 8x12G-SDI optical converter and talkback embedder. It does not come with SFPs.</p>
<p>"Talkback and tally, along with video, are sent to each camera over the SDI program return. The ATEM Talkback Converter takes advantage of the 16 channel SDI audio standard and embeds the talkback into rarely used channels 15 and 16. That means customers don’t need any extra cables to add talkback and tally to their production."</p>
