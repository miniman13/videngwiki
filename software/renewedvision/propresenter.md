## File Format
Presentations created in ProPresenter are saved with a `.pro` file extension. Prior to ProPresenter 7 files included the version number in the extension, for example `.pro6`, `.pro5` letting you know which version the presentation was created in.

ProPresenter 7 files are no longer XML formatted, instead they are using Google Protocol Buffers, meaning you need [this library](https://github.com/greyshirtguy/ProPresenter7-Proto) to create/decode the buffers.
