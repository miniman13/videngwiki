# Resolume Avenue/Arena

Resolume Arena is a software application (for Windows and macOS) enabling real-time video and audio playback, manipulation, and effects processing. It is commonly used in live events, AV productions, concerts, corporate events and more.

Resloume allows users to map video content to various surfaces and shapes, such as flat screens, projections, and 3D objects. This can be done using a variety of mapping tools and techniques, including corner pinning, edge blending, and surface deformation.

Resolume Arena also allows users to play out video content in a variety of ways. They can choose to play video clips in sequence, play them randomly, or play them based on certain triggers or events. Users can also adjust the speed, looping, and direction of video playback, as well as apply various audio and video effects to the content.

In addition, Resolume Arena has a number of features that allow users to control and manipulate the playback of their video content in real-time. This includes the ability to use midi controllers, OSC (Open Sound Control) devices, and other hardware to control the playback of video clips and effects. Users can also use the software's built-in timeline editor to create more complex and synchronized video playback sequences.
