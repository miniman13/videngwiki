<p><strong>What is 2110?</strong></p>
<p>2110 is a replacement for SDI that transports uncompressed video over IP networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is it like NDI?</strong></p>
<p>In that it is video over IP, yes, but in many ways no. 2110 is a SMPTE specification for uncompressed video, NDI is a proprietary protocol that compresses video. 2110 is designed for use with 10G network links or greater, whereas NDI must compress your video streams down to less than 1G of bandwidth.</p>

<h2>SSM vs ASM</h2>
<p>ASM stands for Any-Source Multicast, and SSM, the preferred option for 2110, stands for Source-specific Multicast. With ASM the multicast client doesn't know the multicast sender's unicast address (source), only the multicast group IP's address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With SSM, the multicast client can specify which multicast sender's unicast address (source) in the multicast group it wants without having to discover them as it has to with ASM.</p>
