# Contribution Guidelines
Because this is all community based we have a set of guidelines for everyone to follow to make sure the content contained here is accurate and up to date, and so we don't have massive edit wars over who's right.

## Content
Your content should always be factual and with a solid basis in either current best practices, real life experience, or vendor documentation. This is to ensure we are not leading people in the wrong direction and potentially wasting someones time on a job site.
Because some of the things we do are dependent on location and vendor, there is obviously some flexibility about this, but don't go saying "only this is the only thing that does this" if its obviously not true, this is here to help, not sell products.

Guides are offered more flexibility in their factual nature, as they are typically for a specific workflow or concept, not a specific piece of equipment. However this being said you should not write your guide in a way that makes it seem like the ultimate answer or the only true solution, there are always more ways to do things and what you think is best might not work for someone else.

## Organisation
We have 4 main categories of content, [Hardware](/hardware), [Software](/software), [Development](/en/development) and [Guides](/guides), you should try and make sure you're creating your pages in the correct locations to make it easy to navigate. If you're adding something completely new give a shout on the Discord and your new category will be added to the sidebar.

For Hardware and Software please make the page path `/[hardware|software]/[vendor]/[name]` so we have some semblance of organisation.

Guides can either be under their hardware/software parent, or in `/guides`, but should be linked in the guides page.
